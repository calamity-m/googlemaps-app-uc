Created an Android Application in Android Studio to provide a map of the University of Canberra campus. Includes Google Maps overview of the University of Canberra Campus with full zooming and pins and highlighted areas. Implements Web activities within the application, allowing browsing and quick access of the University of Canberra website. In line with Google maps, it also provides the ability to view a street camera at select locations.
